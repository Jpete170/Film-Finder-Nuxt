# Film Finder

## Overview

This Single Page App uses the [Nuxt.js]([https://nuxtjs.org/](https://nuxtjs.org/)), which is built on top of `Vue`.

The app uses [Bootstrap-Vue]([https://bootstrap-vue.org/](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)) for content styling and `Axios` for fetching data from the [backend]([https://github.com/Jpete170/fastAPI-project](https://github.com/Jpete170/fastAPI-project).

The app is built as a online Film and TV Show database, using a public dataset based on the Netflix catalogue.

The app itself can be found at [here](https://filmfinder.jacksonpeters.dev).
